HTTP API generation basics
==========================

PyPipeline can fully auto-generate a `FastAPI <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`_ HTTP interface on top of your pipeline,
including interactive docs.

.. warning::
   **TODO: this feature is still under development. Docs will follow later.** For a glimpse of what it will look like: see
   `tests/pypipeline_serve_tests/test_01_standard_server.py`.
